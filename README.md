# Hello and Welcome!

Welcome all to the repo for my website, [masondecair.es](http://masondecair.es). This is the second major iteration of this website, in that time I have learnt alot and have moved away from php powered blogging tools and instead I'm now using Jekyll.

I'm hoping with this new site I can use it much as a platform rather than locking myself down to blogs. For the time being it's main purpose is as a place for me to put up my blog posts and writings, expect these sporadically!
