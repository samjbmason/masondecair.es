  <p>My name is Sam, I am a developer/ designer in London, UK, I love learning and building things for the web. These things range from services to help people to geeky tools.</p>

  <p>I currently work at Steer as a teacher and developer. You can hear my ramblings on <a href="http://twitter.com/samjbmason">Twitter</a> and all of the code I churn out on <a href="http://github.com/samjbmason">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <p>Also, all of the source code for this site is online and can be found <a href="https://github.com/samjbmason/maison.io">here</a>. Please feel free to suggest fixes for bugs or improvements.</p>

  <p>I live in North London with my fianc√© Sasha, we also share our abode with our cat, Rufus.</p>

  <p>I'm always up for meeting and speaking to people, old &amp; new. If you want to talk, drop me an email at <a href="mailto:sam.jbmason@gmail.com">sam.jbmason@gmail.com</a>.</p>
