At the beginning of this week I gave my first ever talk on the topic of web dev, this was one of my challenges for 2013 and may be the only one I successfully complete but that's one more than usual. The meet up was held at Google Campus in Shoreditch, a lovely hub for all things innovation and tech related. It has several floors each hosting its own purpose from the Tech Hub incubator to co working space, cafe and some bookable spaces.

The event organisers [Untangle the Web](http://www.meetup.com/Untangling-the-Web-London/) put on the event First Steps in the Web and the purpose of it was to act as an open invitation for people who liked the sound of the tech industry to come along and hear four speakers on different aspects of the industry. I was one of these speakers, my talk was on using Wordpress as not only a blogging CMS but how to tailor it to be a general CMS and creating a nice and easy backend for clients.

The others were on working with a client on a project and the many roles in a design and development company.

On the day of the event I had some slight nerves but nothing that would impede me getting on with my day, but another thing hung over my head that morning. The lovely Sarah Parmenter had posted a [blog post](http://www.sazzy.co.uk/2013/02/speaking-up/)about a disturbing set of events that began last year. I won't go into details here but suffice to say it was bullying and from it looked like it was from someone in the industry. Over the past 6 months or so I have noticed a growing problem of bullying and abusive arguments, everything from twitters spats to entire conferences getting shut down due to sexism. I will save my rant about how none of these things are acceptable for another post, but In summary I'm not cool with any of those actions.

Reading Sarah's post really put under a cloud that Monday but I'm very glad she spoke out about it, it also instilled a new level of fear that when I got up to talk that evening someone was going to pitchfork me from the speaking area. I was worried that I wasn't qualified enough to talk about the web, that I would be laughed off the stage or even worst someone would ask me a question that I had no idea how to answer.

Thankfully there were NO pitchforks No unanswerable questions and people came up to me and congratulated me at the end of it which was brilliant considering of all the "Ahhhhhss" and "Ummmssss" I could hear coming from my mouth (my mum would be so disappointed). I left the meet up feeling invigorated to learn more and create more. I also met some super bright people all of  who were kind, friendly and considerate, they reminded me why I got into Web development in the first place and that is because there are always people out there who are willing to lend a helping hand and guide a noob through the wilderness. I think the day that no longer happens will be the day I get my self down the job centre.
