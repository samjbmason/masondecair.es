This is the first of hopefully many posts for this fine blog. Im not 100% sure yet what it is going to contain yet but hopefully that will figure itself out in time, so lets get going!

I have always wanted to have a blog that contained interesting articles and something that I could use a sort of personal archive of things I would otherwise forget if it were left up to  my brain. The biggest sticking point I have found was what to focus the articles around, I'm passionate about a lot of things but have never felt that I was worthy enough to hold an authoritative opinion on any the topics, It would be at about this point I would give up on writing and sack off the idea for another few months.

However, I now believe I have a fairly strong grasp of the web development world and the languages that surround that if I were to open my mouth it wouldn't be drivel.

Writing has always been a sticking point for me, I really enjoy it but have found it hard to sit down and concentrate putting my thoughts down in a logical way (that and university has a way of beating the enjoyment out it). I also believe that if you do something enough times you will eventually get better at it. This is what happened when I started out as developer, at first the code was bad..real bad, but then slowly but surely it got more legible, flowed nicer and as a result the sites would often look better and work more robustly.

#### That resolution thing…

I really enjoy a challenge and so therefore, while realising that I have *probably* missed the boat on becoming a child music sensation/prodigy eg. Donnie Osmond, I instead will sit down and try to write a blog. I have tied this challenge up in a New Years Resolution type shell, where I have committed to write *at least* one post a week for the length of 2013.

As for the contents of these posts I'm hoping that they will include my general thoughts and musings but that I can also use them to talk about my favourite apps, new music perhaps, design things that have interested me, code snippets that have served me well and generally interesting things from the web.

I would also love to hear feedback from anyone who reads my posts (this feedback can certainly include my terrible grammar and punctuation and how to improve it), my email is sam.jbmason@gmail.com

Check back in the coming weeks for more posts or follow me on twitter [@samjbmason](http://twitter.com/samjbmason) as I will be posting links on there.

Thanks for reading
