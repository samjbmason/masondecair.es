**tl;dr** I have put up a [dotfiles project](https://github.com/samjbmason/dotfiles) on Github. Take a look if you want to keep your dotfiles synced and to hand on any machine.

I have recently moved to a two computer setup my Macbook Air for personal use and a Mac mini for the office. I initially thought I would constantly be getting tripped up by not having files to hand, however, due to the lovely [Dropbox](http://db.tt/RPhGHKA) most of my important files are on both.

My biggest problem was in fact keeping my developer tools and environment in sync. I needed a way to keep all my dotfiles in sync. I went in search of a simple solution and came across this awesome post by [Michael Smalley](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/), I took his idea chopped it up a bit and removed a few things that I didn't need and created a forked version of it [here](https://github.com/samjbmason/dotfiles). Check out the README and feel free to take any of the code you want. If you think of an awesome idea please drop it into the issues or send me a pull request. Enjoy!
