title: Rdio killed the Spotify star
---
If you are friends with me on Facebook you will have probably been bombarded with my constant listening habits and for this I'm very sorry (Katy Perry was not my song choiceâ€¦I swear!). I like a lot of others were early adopters to Spotify and while at first I thought it was a cool way of listening to music without my iTunes at hand, it quickly became my go to app regardless of whether I was on my laptop or not. I had a few issues with Spotify's UI choices but they have steadily got better over time.

The reason I jumped ship was not because of better features or the lure of a slightly different music catalogue it was in fact due to a piece of hardware that arrived at the Benchmark Studio's last week, a Sonos speaker for that matter. Now I have never been really that sold on the whole ecosystem but it was very nice to have that warm sound that you can only get from proper speakers. I logged in and soon noticed that only one Spotify account could be logged in at any given time. This is obviously no fault of Spotify's and I understand why it has to be that way for Sonos but nevertheless it was freakin' annoying. I noticed that Sonos had Rdio access built in so I thought "why not" and signed up for the 5 day free premium trial.


####Dark vs Light
At first I was slightly hesitant and scoffed when I couldn't find a couple of the bands I used to listen to on Spotify, at first I thought this would be a real issue for me in reality I haven't been that bothered as its such a small minority and where Rdio lacks there it makes up for it in nearly every other way.

The service now includes a new remote control which allows you to control Rdio is it is playing on another device you can also then "Pull" it your device if you so wish.

The new iOS app is a joy to use and seems a lot  more responsive than the Spotify equivalent, it utilises the now frequently used   Off-Canvas layout that Facebook and Path have championed. When playing a an album it tackles the artwork vs track listing display very well. You start with at the album artwork and a now playing bar  you can then scroll down to the track listing underneath it there is a contextual button at the top that allows you to jump to either view. This looks great on the iPhone 5 as it takes full advantage of the taller screen.

I like that Rdio allows you to store albums to a library, as I'm pretty indecisive about what I want to listen to its nice going to a screen that displays all of them. I also see it as a really neat way of creating a curated taste as you can listen to any music with ease and then any albums you really love you can simply add them to your collection to show followers what your ideal taste is rather than them seeing that time you played Niki Minaj while drunk one night.

####The Devs Choice
Both services have a friending aspect which allows you to connect to social networks and see what your friends are listening to. Spotify has buddied up with Facebook and Rdio has gone with Twitter. While I enjoy seeing what my friends listen to I would like to think I know them well enough to kind of guess what genre's and bands they would listen to. Most of the people I follow on Rdio are folks from the web industry and I don't know why but I find it interesting to see what they are listening to.

So to sum up, even though I was pushed a little bit into using Rdio its a decision I have not looked back on and for the time being it has won my monthly music subscription.
