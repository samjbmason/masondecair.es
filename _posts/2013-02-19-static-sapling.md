Just a quick post announcing that my fork of the HTML5 Boilerplate can be found on [Github](https://github.com/samjbmason/static-sapling). Please feel free to fork it, hack it, basically do whatever you want with it.

For those of you who were in attendance at the First Steps in the Web Meetup at Google Campus this was the repo I was referring to. I will also be posting our starter theme for WordPress, Sapling, on GitHub soon.
