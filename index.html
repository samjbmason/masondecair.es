  <p>My name is Sam, I am a developer/ designer in London, UK. I build things for the web. These things range from services
    to help people to geeky tools.</p>

  <p>I'm currently an engineer at Rapha bringing cycling and technology closer together. You can hear my ramblings on
    <a href="http://twitter.com/samjbmason">Twitter</a> and all of the code I write and open source is on
    <a href="http://github.com/samjbmason">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <p>Also, all of the source code for this site is online and can be found
    <a href="https://github.com/samjbmason/samjbmason.github.io">here</a>. Feel free to suggest fixes for bugs or improvements.</p>

  <p>I live in North London with my family, and our surly house mate Rufus the cat.</p>

  <p>I'm always up for meeting and speaking to people, old &amp; new. If you want to talk, drop me an email at
    <a href="mailto:sam.jbmason@gmail.com">sam.jbmason@gmail.com</a>.</p>
