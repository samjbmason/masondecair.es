title: Sapling Wordpress Starter Theme

Today I would like to announce [Sapling](https://github.com/samjbmason/sapling), a lean WordPress starter theme.

At Benchmark I would say about 90% of the sites we ship are powered by WordPress, I won't go into the numerous reasons why I think its brilliant there are plenty of posts on that very topic. There was one problem though and that was good Boilerplate theme, one devoid of style but packed full of useful features and presets on a functional basis. Don't get me wrong though there are lots of really good ones out there that attempt to solve this issue such as [Starkers](http://viewportindustries.com/products/starkers/), [Bones](http://themble.com/bones/) and [_underscores](http://underscores.me/), but none of them fitted into our workflow without some issues.

Then I found [Roots](http://www.rootstheme.com/) it had all these great features built in and was pretty much what we had been looking for apart from one issue, it had Bootstrap built in. We decided that we would fork this project and use this as a starting point, to create our own theme. So thats what we did we stripped out all of the design and stripped it back to just the features we wanted.

You can find it up on [Github](https://github.com/samjbmason/sapling), please feel free to fork-it, hack-it, use-it.
