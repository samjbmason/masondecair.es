title: Sinatra Starter
---
*tldr; I have built a starter project for sinatra apps, it's pretty cool if you like that kind of stuff, check it out [here on Github](https://github.com/samjbmason/sinatra-starter)*

I'm about to announce my first proper web app but before I do that I wanted to announce a little open source project that has evolved from it.

When I wanted to learn ruby I decided to move away from starting with a framework like rails as it seemed to abstract a lot code away, so I decided to use Sinatra instead.

It may only be useful to a handful of people but I have created a small "sinatra starter" project that gives me a basic starting base for using the lightweight framework with all my commonly used gems, it comes with some instructions on how to setup and run. Obviously this will probably be updated over time but if anyone finds it useful it's all yours.

Feel free to hack at it, share it and do what you will.
