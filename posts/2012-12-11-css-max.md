Being an OCD person, I like to keep things clean and uncomplicated when I build sites, this was especially true when building this blog. One of the ways to do this is to use a very lightweight CMS like [Statamic](http://statamic.com/) (but more on that in later post), the second is to make sure I delivered my assets in the smallest sizes possible. This is great for site speed which hopefully leads to happier users who might be reading over a slow mobile connection.

However, all this compressing makes CSS and other text based assets pretty unreadable, this didn't sit that well with me as when I was a younger developer still learning the ropes of HTML & CSS I would use View Source to see how sites were coded. I would like to have some way of providing this resource to others without it hindering my site performance. Thankfully the very talented [Daniel Eden](http://daneden.me/) felt the same and wrote a brilliant and in depth post on the merits of [max.css](http://daneden.me/max-css/) files.

I fully support Dan's idea and therefore if you wish to find my full, uncompressed CSS in all its glorious commented fashion [Head over here](http://maison.io/_themes/maison/css/app.max.css).
